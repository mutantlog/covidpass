# Environment Setup

The whole solution is made up of 4 repos.

1. covidpass (Wallet Pass creation front-end, port 3000)
2. covidpassApiDotNet (Wallet Pass signing service, Apple specific, port 80)
3. verifier (web app for scanning, port 5001;  GCP cloud functions /register /verify in support of #1)
4. hit-counter (simple python script running in VM, web enabled using flask, port 8080)

The steps were tested against a standard ubuntu LTS 18 vm running in GCP

## GCP console - Firewall - New Firewall Rule
* allow-covidpass-ports, port 3000,80,5001,5003,8080 tcp/inbound

## GCP console - VM setup
* ubuntu LTS 18, 2 core, 4Gb RAM, allow all GCP API, network tag (allow-covidpass-ports), fixed external ip will be helpful

ssh into the newly created vm

Install docker
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

Enable non-root usage of docker
```sh
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
```
exit SSH session and login again

Install yarn
```sh
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install yarn 
```

Upgrade node to 14
```sh
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

Prepare to start
```sh
    mkdir web
    cd web
```

Repo 1 (https://github.com/billylo1/covidpass)

    git clone https://github.com/billylo1/covidpass.git
    cd covidpass
    yarn install

    note external IP of your dev machines
    modify .env.local and replace localhost with your {vm-external-ip} 

    yarn dev

    access it from your workstation's browser (http://vm-external-ip:3000)
    you should see on the yarn output compiling... sentry initialized and browser showing page

Repo 2 (https://github.com/billylo1/CovidPassApiNet)

    cd ~/web
    git clone https://github.com/billylo1/CovidPassApiNet
    cd CovidPassApiNet/CovidPassApiNet
    cp appsettings.example.json appsettings.json

    setup Apple Developer Certificate (assume current directory is the above)

        1. Sign into your Apple Developer Account
        2. Go to Certificates, Identifiers and Profiles
        3. Register a new Pass Type Identifier under the Identifiers tab
        4. Create a new Pass Type ID Certificate under the Certificates tab
        5. Select your previously created Pass Type Identifier in the process
        6. Move your new certificate to the My Certificates tab in the keychain
        7. Export your certificate as a .p12 file (make a note of passphrase)
        8. Create a text file named AppleDeveloperPassword with your passphrase in it
        9. Install node.js and download the passkit-keys script
        10. Create a keys folder and put the .p12 file inside
        11. Run ./passkit-keys <path to your keys folder>
        12. copy the .pem file to ~/web/CovidPassApiNet/CovidPassApiNet/AppDeveloperCerticate.pem
        13. Open keychain - System Keychain - Certificates
        14. Export Apple Developer Relations Certification Authority to AppleCaCertificate.pem
        15. chmod 600 Apple*.pem 

        (Reminder: pls protect these files as they contain private key and passphrases. Do not add them to your repo.)
    
    docker build . -t covidpassapinet
    docker run covidpassapinet -p 80:80
